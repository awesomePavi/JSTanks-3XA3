						bottom of the map which you have to protect from enemy tanks trying to destroy it. You will have to destroy
						all enemy tanks in order to win.<br><br>Your tank will be damaged when hit with enemy shots. Multiple hits
						from the enemy will destroy your tank and the game will be over.<br><br>The map will include brick walls and steel walls. 
						Brick walls can be destroyed by firing at them once. Steel walls are stronger than brick walls and require multiple shots
						to be destroyed.<br><br>Good luck and enjoy!</p>
