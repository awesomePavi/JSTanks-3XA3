\section{General Information}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document is a report outlining the results of the testing, validation and verification process 
that was to be followed by JSTanks after the build process.

\subsection{Scope}
This project was designed to port an existing Java based game to the web
where it will no longer be required to be download and ran locally, instead
it will be able to run in the browser. The tests cover all functionality of the 
game both functional and non-functional.

\section{Tools-Used}
The team used an automated test script as well as Google forms, as tools,
to help in the testing process. The script was used to perform many tests
as fast as possible, as many times as needed to ensure repeatable results
to be certain that the game passed its requirements. Where as google forms
was used as a means to build and distribute a questionnaire, in order to get 
qualitative feedback on the game to check if it passed the non-functional 
requirements set for it.

\subsection{Automated Test Script}
An automated testing script was made., to check for most functional requirements.
The script was able to do many repetitive tests, much quicker then an individual
is able to set up a scenario and run through a test. The script was also able to 
pick out specific calls as they occurred in order to see if the correct result occurred.

\subsubsection{Load In Scripts}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Each test ran is located in a separate test file labelled testN, where N is the test number.
	This script dynamically tries to load in test scripts numbered form 0 to 100, to allow for 
	tests to be added on the fly.
\item No other tests will begin until this script loads in the tests, if the script is unable to find the
	scripts then their is an error and no tests are ran.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Page Load}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Ensures that all HTML pages and subsequent scripts on each page load up, this is
	checked by the script binding to the webpage and waiting for loading of files to 
	complete. Once all files are loaded for a specified page the script moves onto the
	next page.
\item If any one page takes more than two seconds to load then the test fails.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Menu Functionality}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Runs through all menus on every page and checks that Javascript functions are 
	linked and function correctly.
\item If any one javascript call on a menu does not work, or throws an error, the whole 
	test fails
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Board Boundaries}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Creates a blank board and places a user tank in one corner, then tries to move the
	tank 20 times in one direction, (Trying to throw and error on a 15 x 15 board).
\item The game then places wall objects on the board in a cross pattern, then runs the same 
	test failing if the tank tile moves to a spot where a wall object is located.  
\item The script then replaces the wall objects with steel walls and tries again.
\item The script then replaces the steel wall object with home bases tries again,
\item If the tank entity moves to  a location that it should not the whole test fails. 
	The check is done via a script cross checking the x and y position of the tank with
	the board.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Game Pause}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Checks the pause and unpause features works correctly
\item When the game is paused a script runs code and takes snapshots of the board array
	checking if the board changes at all while paused. 
\item The script mimics key press of 'p' to pause 
\item The script then replaces the steel wall object with home bases tries again,
\item The script then mimics the continue button being pressed as well
\item If the board updates while paused or the continue feature or 'p' key
	do not work correctly the test fails.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ai Randomness}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Checks the AI functions by starting a new game and removing all tanks
	but one AI tank.
\item If over the course of two seconds the tank has a net displacement of 2 tiles
	it passes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Projectiles}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Checks that the projectile fire function fires a projectile
\item Checks that when a projectile hits a wall it takes damage
\item Checks that when a projectile hits a steel wall it takes damage
\item Checks that when a projectile hits a base it takes damage
\item Checks that when a projectile hits a tank it takes damage
\item Checks that a projectile is dequeued when it hits something
	or goes off screen
\item Does this by binding to multiple functions in the game javascript
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Player Tank}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Checks that user input works correctly, does so by triggering 
	keyboard events.
\item The script cross checks the old tank position with new positions 
	on the board, to check if it moved accordingly.
\item The script checks that the fire command had worked correctly by 
	placing a wall where the tank should, be and seeing if it was 
	damaged.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Game End}
\begin{itemize}  
\item Checks the game ends when the home base is destroyed.
\item  Checks with multiple home bases.
\item Checks the game ends when the AI is killed.
\item  Checks with multiple AI.
\item Checks if the game ends when the player tank is destroyed.
\item Test is done by script binding to the end game call, if any scenario
	does not end the game then the test is failed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questionnaire}
A questionnaire was issued via google forms to ensure non-functional requirements 
were met through the process of performing a qualitative analysis to determine 
whether the requirements were met. The questionnaire issued was 7 pages long 
and was filled by 8 people. The links below will forward you to a PDF of the 
questionnaire and the google form itself.

\section{Test Summary}
The game has passed all the tests designed by the team in order to check that it meets all 
functional and non-functional requirements. These tests were done via automated testing 
using a custom script, manual testing by the team as-well as by issuing a questionnaire 
and using feedback to determine if the game succeeded or failed. Below are a series of
tables, listing the requirement tests status and last test date (the requirements link to the 
full requirements located further down this document).

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}
The open source game software we are working on is simply a Java application 
in its existent form. We are uploading the same game on a web browser which 
requires a different programming language altogether. As a result, we have not 
been able to use any existing code and have had to program the game completely 
from scratch. We have also not looked into the Java code to learn its 
implementation style or use any ideas for specific functions. Therefore, any 
similarities between our code and the existing code are coincidental. \\ \\
The major difference between the two implementations is that we have HTML, and 
CSS files in addition to the JavaScript source code which are required for any 
kind of web development. The existing code works with multiple classes 
representing different aspects of the game which can be seen in our code as 
well. However, it has more classes, three of them which are main method 
classes which can be explained by the programming language used. Our 
implementation has no main method or class, but instead the HTML file is used 
as the main class which drives the whole game. Another important difference is 
the style of programming; the existing implementation has made use of threads 
which we have not as we are still learning to work with JavaScript. The use of 
object oriented programming is evident in both implementations. For example, 
objects for tanks, bots, and barriers are included in both.
