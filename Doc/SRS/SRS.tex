\section{Project Drivers:}
\subsection{Purpose of the Project}

\subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort:} The
objective of this project is to expand the accessibility options for the famous
Tanks game. The game we will be working on is currently a stand-alone program
which requiring a Java interface to compile or any other means of manual
compilation. This can be an issue for a lot of users as they might not have the
necessary knowledge or have compatibility problems with their platform. Our plan
to transform this Java Program to a web-based application will rid of any issues
and allow users to experience playing the game without any difficulties. What
motivates us to go on with this project is the will to be a part of the game
development community which is a power station providing a great number of
options for people seeking entertainment through video games. This game is not a
serious problem and is not necessarily a significant business opportunity for
our host. This is because there are various versions of the Tanks game already
available online for users at the present moment. This however is only theory
based because the host popularity and traffic has a great impact on how
significant this game is in terms of business.

\subsubsection{Goals of the Project:} The ultimate service goal we are trying to
achieve is to make easy access of the Tanks game for the users. We will be using
JavaScript as our programming language in order to make the game runnable on a
website. We will then decide on a host that will best suite our product and help
popularize it.

\subsection{Stakeholders:} 
\subsubsection{Client:}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Fig1.png}


\subsubsection{Partner and Collaborative Applications:} 
The product requires a
text editor for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation to take place in.
Because it is a web based software, it requires a browser with JavaScript and a
server provided by the client. There are no other partner and collaborative
applications for this product.


\subsubsection {Off-The-Shelf-Software:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Text editor i.e. Notepad++
\item A web browser i.e. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome
\item JavaScript for implementation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workspace Environment:} 
There is no specific working
environments for this product, it can be used as long as there is a computer
desktop or a laptop (portability) and an internet connection.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints:} 
The given deadline for the finished
product is December 8th, 2016. In addition, a proof of concept demonstration
requires a minimum amount of implementation done to be presented on the week of
October 17, 2016.

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints:} 
There are no budget constraints to the
development of this product. However, a goal imposed upon ourselves as a team is
to use absolutely no money in the making of this product.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions:} 
The project is base on an existing
application called tanks which is an open source with 684 lines of code. The aim
is to convert such game from the local PC version to the website version using
JS which allow users to enjoy the game without downloading.\\\\ The game is
intend to be run on the web page, so we assume that modern computers which are
capable of running latest browsers is available to users. Since the game take
the keyboard as the input tool, a keyboard is also required to play the game.

\section{The Scope of the Work} 
 \subsection{Current Situtation}
 Currently
computer systems based games run solely on the system itself and  require the
end-user to download and install dependencies for each game they would like to
play. These games are designed for few systems and require particular specs to
operate. The process that JS Tanks plan to modify is the above to make games
platform independent and hardware independent.

\subsection {Individual product use cases}
\begin{enumerate}
\item When the user clicks?start a new game?in the menu, the whole web page gets
 refreshed which makes all stuff in the game back to their initial positions.

\item When the user clicks ?pause?in the menu, the game come into a pause state.
 All stuff in the game freeze and stay in their temporal position until the 
 button?continue?in the menu is clicked.

\item When the user clicks ?continue?in the menu, the game is activated from 
the pause state that all stuff run as the routine if it was the pause state 
before the click. And the click of ?continue?cause no effect if it was not the 
pause state before the click.

\item When the user click the different ?level?in the menu, the speed of tanks 
controlled by the AI changes in the game. The higher the level is, the higher 
the speed is.

\item When the user clicks ?introduction?in the menu, the web page pops up a 
window with the information of the game in it.

\item When the user clicks ?quit?in the menu, the game comes to the end state 
that the GUI turns into black with only the menu on it.

\item When the user presses the ?up?, ?down?, ?left? or ?right? key on the 
keyboard, the tank controlled by the user moves to the exact direction according 
to the key. If the user keep pressing the key, the tank keeps moving until it 
hits the wall or the boundary of the map.
\item When the user press the ?F?key on the keyboard, the tank controlled by the
 user launches a bullet. The bullet keeps moving and disappears when it hits 
 another tank, a wall or the boundary of the map.
\item When the bullet launched by the user?s tank hits another tank controlled 
by the AI, that tank and the bullet disappear all together at the same time.
\item When the bullet hits a brick wall, the wall and the bullet disappear all 
together at the same time.
\item When the bullet hits a steel wall, the bullet disappears and the steel 
wall keep existing in the same position.
\item When the tank controlled by the user or the home base is hit by the 
bullet which is launched by the tank controlled by the AI, one tenth of blood 
in the blood bar decreases.
\item When the blood bar is empty which means that the home base is destroyed, 
the web page pops up a window showing that the game is over.
\item When the tank controlled by the user cross over a heart, one-tenth of 
blood increases in the blood bar. The blood does not increase if the blood bar 
is full.
\item When the tank controlled by the user is the only tank in the map, the web 
page pops up a window showing that the user wins the game, and then the game 
come to the end state.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements:}
\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements:}

\subsubsection{Appearance Requirements:}
The game shall acknowledge the client hosting it on a website by showing its
credentials upon starting up. The game should be visually attractive and have
appealing colour schemes. The game will have many tanks other than the user
tank. The player tank will be coloured differently and all AI tanks will be
coloured the same to make it easier for the player to tell the difference. There
shall be brick sprites which make up the player?s home base and graphics for
bullets fired from all tanks.

\subsubsection{Style Requirements:}
JS Tanks shall colour the tanks and the background so that they do not make it
hard for the user to focus on the screen. The game shall have a menu with
different options that the player can go through. i.e. Play, Instructions, Quit.

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements:}
\subsubsection{Ease of use requirements:}
JS Tanks being a very simplistic game shall be very ease to play for all users. 
The interface as well as the controls shall be very basic, but at the same time, 
the gameplay should be satisfying for the player.
\subsubsection{Personalization and Internationalization Requirements:}
This is not applicable to this game.
\subsubsection{Learning Requirements:}
The user requires no further knowledge than to be able to open the browser.
\subsubsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements:}
The user should know simple English to surf through the menu and read 
instructions.
\subsubsection{Accessibility Requirements:}
The user should be able to access the game from any platform with a web browser 
supporting JavaScript.
\subsection{Performance:}
JS Tanks should be able to operate with minimal hardware specific requirements 
for the basis of the project is stray away from specific and high end hardware. 
The game should be able to operate with little input latency and no notable 
frame rates.
\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements:}
The game should run on Chromium web-browsers and firefox browsers, across 
operating systems most notably Windows and OSX systems. The game should run 
within the web browser and require no connection to a server for processing.
\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements:}
The code for the game should be simple and easy to understand and breakdown 
to help those maintaining the code or others whom plan to learn from it or 
build their own Java Script application
\subsection{Security Requirements:}
The game should not access nor compromise user data, nor should it access or 
compromise the hosting entities data.
\subsection{Cultural Requirements:}
JS Tanks shall be available only in English and contain no directly offensive 
remarks to any culture or nation.
\subsection{Legal Requirements:}
The game must abide by Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation.
\\\\The game should try to meet the standards set by Canada's Accessibility 
Legislation.

\section{Project Issues:}
\subsection{Open Issues:}
Currently there are two issues plaguing our development of this project. Firstly
the members of JSTanks are not particularly affluent in Java Script which is
slowing down development as the team must learn as it develops. Secondly,
deriving from the first issue the team is unsure of Java Script in its ability
to create and handle objects, this issue will be looked into quickly; if Java
Script is unable to create or handle objects then a more procedural approach
will need to be followed.

\subsection{Off the shelf solutions:}
\subsubsection{Ready Made:}
Ready made solutions which can be used are simple parsers to convert to Java
Script but to do this, the java must first be parsed into another language for
no direct Java to Java Script parser is available and by doing multiple language
conversion efficiency can easily be lost.

\subsubsection{Reusable Components:}

The components of the original project cannot be re-used due to the language and
platform barrier, but the existing algorithms can be broken down and re-used but
this is to be determined.

\subsubsection{Products that can be copied:}

Currently there is no full product which may be duplicated but what can be
copied are Java Script tutorials for specific functions which can be merged
together to create an acceptable result.

\subsection{New Problems:}
For Revision 1
\subsection{Tasks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Break down original project into workable components
\item Convert Java components into algorithms and then into Java Script
\item Merge components together to make fluent and efficient game
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Risks:}

The only potential risk the development process might have is that we are
learning new languages; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This learning period will
take some space in our Development timeline and might under specific
circumstances cause delays to the project schedule. This in turn, could
compromise the quality of the final product. i.e. poor gameplay.

\subsection{Costs:}
Not applicable as there are no set constraints for cost.
\subsection{User Documentation/Training:}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements:}
Not Applicable.
\subsubsection{Training Requirements:}
The game menu shall have an option giving a brief explanation of game and 
controls. 
\subsection{Waiting Room:}
\begin{itemize}
\item In-Game Audio
\item Mobile edition
\item Multiplayer
\end{itemize}
