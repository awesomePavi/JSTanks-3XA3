\subsection*{Meeting Plan:}  
The meeting plan we have come up with will ensure
we are on schedule throughout this project. On top of the weekly labs on Mondays
and Thursdays (ITB 236), we have decided to hold a meeting every Wednesday in
Thode Library at 5:30pm. In addition, there will be a short online meeting on
the team facebook group every Sunday evening. This is to make sure that each
team member is on track for completing there task. This online meeting will also
allow for the planning of work in the coming week. These  meetings are
strategically set to ensure that consistent work is being done every week, since
large gaps between two consecutive meetings are avoided. We have decided to
rotate the facilitators with every meeting whom will be responsible for the
meeting agenda, a tool that will be used to plan and reflect every meeting.

\subsection*{Team Communication Plan:}  
The primary means of communication our
team will be using throughout this project is a facebook group chat. The
facebook group will be used for sharing ideas, research, questions and issues
that are discovered while working individually. However, the implementation
(including programming issues) and documentation will be communicated through
GitLab. We are also using google docs as a means to work together on the
documents involved in this project.

\subsection*{Team Member roles:}

\subsection*{Git workflow plan:}  
A good Git Workflow is key to the success of a
project and must be determined before all else; our team has decided to go with
a simple git workflow where in we branch off of the master. Using this branch as
a central branch we will be debugging and adding features merging with the
master branch upon reaching milestones such as movement, graphics, etc. Merging
conflicts with the central branch will be handled by the two members with
conflicts working together to ensure neither of their features are affected. In
short our workflow will consist of a central branch off of the master, with
conflicts resolved as a team.

\subsection*{Proof of Concept Demonstration plan:}  
The proof of concept
demonstration will show that we are capable of of completing what we set out to
do, we will prove this  by overcoming what we believe to be the most difficult
task. Since we plan to learn JavaScript throughout the development process we b
elieve that the most difficult task will be to take user input through the
browser and into our game. The demo we plan to showcase will consist of a cube
which moves around the browser window, with respect to user input, with bounds
so that it does not go off screen. We are not deterred  with the task of
bringing our project to class in order to demonstrate for it is web-based and
runs in the browser window. For our proof of concept demo we will open an html
file which will run the script for our block with boundaries which will move
based on keyboard input.

\subsection*{Technology:} 
Technology has always been an important part of
software development. It is usually composed of four major parts which are the
programming language, the integrated development environment, the testing
framework and the document generation. For the part of programming language, the
plan is to build the structure of the website with HTML and CSS, running
JavaScript to complete the part of the game. As for IDE, we decided to use web-
storm and notepad++. The reason of choosing web-storm is becasue of its smart
and convenient features which are able to analyze the project to provide the
best code auto-completion results with hundreds of built-in inspections. And
notepad++ allows working with multiple open files in a single window which is
better than the built-in  Windows text editor. Pertaing to the esting framework,
Qunit is a good choice for JavaScript which is similar to Junit which we have
expereince with for Java. As for documentation, YUIdoc was choosen becasue it
can be used to document the code clearly and stably.

\subsection*{Coding Style:} 
Based on coding habits of all members in the group,
a unified coding style has been set up. We decided to use K\&R style for the
placement of the braces in compound statement. For the part of naming variables,
camel case will be used throughout all the code which will make it look uniform.
We also agreed to follow commenting standards to ensure that when looking back
at the code it will still be understandable.
